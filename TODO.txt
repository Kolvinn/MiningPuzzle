- Create a proper ordering of layers with consistent zindex (Perhaps even change just the sprite level to be a sub viewport)
- Add use of viewports for text such that they ignore the origin viewport size
- Add (green) UI representation of what tiles/ore nodes each different cart will mine along their path
- Fix level target duplicating conditions and not saving them
- Implement hardness more usefully. I.e., make better UI
- Animation for taking resources out of the cart and checking against level targets
- Add level targets, mine carts, and starting positions outside the map
- Add rail connections between levels (i.e., from edge to start and frrom level targets to end)
- Add boulder blocking the way or something similar that gets removed on level complete
- Add GoNext level button on complete
- Add Reset level button on main UI
- Plan and make better tile maps
- Add a TileBlock object that cannot be placed on which affects map size and shape. Do for both placement and designer.
- Add a gold/silver/bronze star level for different types of level target conditions. 
- Disable Start button after level start. reinable after  reset.
- Plan for a more detailed tutorial
- Add sounds for main soundtrack, stone hit, stone break, etc.
